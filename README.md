# Tic-Tac-Toe using MPI (mpi4py)

A terminal-based implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using MPI (Message Passing Interface) with the `mpi4py` library. This project demonstrates inter-process communication, synchronization, and turn-based logic across two processes.

## Features

-  Turn-based multiplayer gameplay
-  Parallel execution with MPI
-  Message-based coordination between processes
-  Input validation and win/draw condition detection

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [`mpi4py`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/)
- MPI runtime (`mpiexec`, `mpirun`, or equivalent)
